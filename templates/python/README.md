# Advent of Code Python Template

## Usage

This template is to get you started in Python for Advent of Code.

To use it,
make a new folder in the current year and day with your GitHub username. Then,
copy the `main.py` file from here to there. Next, make a file called
`input.txt`, and add your puzzle input to that file.

Finally, navigate to that folder in the terminal, and run:

`python main.py < input.txt`

As an example, if I wanted to create a folder for day 1 of 2020, I would create
a new folder in `2020/day-01/AngelOnFira/`, and copy the `main.py` file from
this folder. Then, I would create a file called `input.txt` and add my puzzle
input. Finally, I would change directory to that folder with

`cd 2020/day-01/AngelOnFira/`

and run

`python main.py < input.txt`

## Example Solutions

Make sure you're in the `templates/python` directory in the terminal. Then run:

`python examples/2016-day1/main.py < examples/2016-day1/input.txt`
