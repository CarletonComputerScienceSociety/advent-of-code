# Advent of Code JS Template
## Usage
This template is to get you started in JavaScript for Advent of Code.

To use it, make a new folder in the current year and day with your GitHub username. Then, copy the `template.js` file from here to there. Next, make a file called `input.txt`, and add your puzzle input to that file.

Finally, navigate to that folder in the terminal, and run:

`node template.js`

As an example, if I wanted to create a folder for day 1 of 2020, I would create a new folder in 2020/day-01/AdiChops/, and copy the `template.js` file from this folder. Then, I would create a file called `input.txt` and add my puzzle input. Finally, I would change directory to that folder with

`cd 2020/day-01/AdiChops/`

and run

`node template.js`
